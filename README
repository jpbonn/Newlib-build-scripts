These scripts build newlib for the LM32 using Clang.

The Newlib build process depends on the gcc-lm32 tool chain for the linker, assembler and ranlib so those tools should be built first. The steps to build newlib are as follows:

1)    checkout the newlib scripts to directory of your choice: $NEWLIBTOP.
        # git clone git@github.com:jpbonn/Newlib-build-scripts.git $NEWLIBTOP

2)    Run the downloaded Makefile. It will download the newlib source code and apply the required patches from the Milkymist repository.
        # cd $NEWLIBTOP 
        # make

3)    Run the build-libs script to do the build:
        # cd $NEWLIBTOP
        # ./build-libs
